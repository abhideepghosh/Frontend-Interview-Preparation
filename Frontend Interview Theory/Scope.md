## Definition Of Scope
- In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables, functions, and other identifiers within a particular portion of code.

## There are four types of scopes in JavaScript: lexical scope, functional scope, block scope, and global scope.
1. Lexical scope: Lexical scope refers to the scope that is determined by the placement of variables and functions in the code. It is also sometimes referred to as static scope. In JavaScript, variables and functions declared outside of any function or block have a global scope, which means they are visible throughout the code. Variables and functions declared inside a function have a local scope, which means they are visible only within that function.
2. Functional scope: Functional scope is a type of lexical scope that is created by functions. Variables and functions declared inside a function have a local scope that is accessible only within that function. This is known as functional scope.
3. Block scope: Block scope is a type of scope that was introduced in ES6 with the introduction of let and const keywords. Block scope refers to the visibility of variables declared inside curly braces {}. Variables declared using let and const have block scope, which means they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.
4. Global scope: Global scope refers to the scope that is accessible throughout the code, including all functions and blocks. Variables and functions declared outside of any function or block have a global scope.

## Significance Of Scope
- Understanding these different types of scopes is important in JavaScript, because it affects the accessibility and visibility of variables and functions in your code.
- It is important to understand which variables are accessible from where, to avoid errors and conflicts in your code.
