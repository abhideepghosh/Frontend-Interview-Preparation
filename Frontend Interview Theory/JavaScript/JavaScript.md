## Key Points On JavaScript

- High Level: The Developers don't have to worry about memory and resource management unlike in low level programming languages like C and C++. The downside is that JavaScript is not as fast as low level languages.
- Garbage Collected: JavaScript engine has an algorithm to clean unused and not referenced objects.
- Interpreted Or Just In Time Compiled: Mix of Interpretation and compilation.
- Multi-Paradigm: Can Follow Procedural, Functional and Object Oriented Programming paradigm. Also can follow both imperative and declarative approach.
- Prototype Based Object Oriented: Every object has a prototype object which contains methods that can be used on the object.
- First Class Functions: Functions are simply treated as variables. We can pass them into other functions, and return them from functions.
- Dynamically Typed Language: We don't assign types to the variables. They are automatically assigned in the runtime and can easily be changed based on the next value assignment to the variable.
- JavaScript is single threaded.
- Non Blocking Event Loop Concurrency Model: JavaScript has a single thread. But by using an event loop, it takes long running task, executes them in the background, and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished.
