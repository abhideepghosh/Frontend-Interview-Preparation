## Definition Of Semantic HTML

- Semantic HTML refers to using HTML markup to convey meaning and information to both human readers and web crawlers that index content for search engines. It involves using specific HTML tags to clearly indicate the purpose and context of the content they contain.
- For example, using the `<header>` tag to define the header section of a webpage, the `<nav>` tag to define the navigation links, the `<main>` tag to define the main content of the page, and the `<footer>` tag to define the footer section of a webpage.
- Using semantic HTML can make a webpage more accessible and easier to understand for people with disabilities who rely on assistive technologies to browse the web.
- It also helps search engines better understand the content of a webpage, which can improve its ranking in search results.
- Overall, using semantic HTML can help create more accessible, readable, and maintainable web pages that are easier for users to find and navigate.
