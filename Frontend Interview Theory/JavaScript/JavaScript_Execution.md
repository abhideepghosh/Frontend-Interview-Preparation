## Definition Of JavaScript Execution

- JavaScript execution refers to the process of interpreting and executing JavaScript code in a browser or a server-side environment like Node.js.
- When a browser loads a webpage that contains JavaScript code, the browser's JavaScript engine (such as V8 in Chrome or SpiderMonkey in Firefox) processes the code and executes it.

## Steps Involved In JavaScript Execution

1. Tokenization: The JavaScript code is broken down into individual tokens (keywords, operators, strings, etc.) by the parser.
2. Parsing: The tokens are analyzed and transformed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which represents the structure of the code in a tree-like form.
3. Compilation: The AST is converted into low-level byte code, which is then optimized for performance.
4. Execution: The optimized code is executed line-by-line, with the JavaScript engine keeping track of variable and function scope, as well as the call stack.
5. During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine interacts with the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) to update the webpage as needed.
6. The engine also handles asynchronous operations such as network requests and timers, using mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await.
