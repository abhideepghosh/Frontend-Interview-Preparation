## Definition Of DOM

- DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents that is used to represent and manipulate HTML and XML documents in a structured manner. The DOM provides a hierarchical tree-like structure of objects that represent elements, attributes, and text in a web page.
- In JavaScript, the DOM provides a way to access and manipulate the HTML and XML elements of a web page dynamically. This means that JavaScript code can create, read, modify, and delete elements and attributes in real-time, based on user interactions or other events.
- The DOM is often used in conjunction with JavaScript libraries and frameworks like jQuery, React, and Angular, which provide more powerful and streamlined methods for manipulating the DOM.
