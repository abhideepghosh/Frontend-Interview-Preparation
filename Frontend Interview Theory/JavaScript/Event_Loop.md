## Definition Of An Event Loop

- In JavaScript, the event loop is a key mechanism that enables non-blocking I/O operations, making it possible to write performant and responsive code. It is a fundamental part of the JavaScript runtime and provides an asynchronous execution model.
- The event loop is a continuous process that checks the call stack and the event queue for tasks to execute. When a task is added to the event queue, the event loop picks it up and pushes it onto the call stack, where it is executed. Once the task is completed, the event loop continues to check the queue and the stack for more tasks to execute.
- In essence, the event loop allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations by delegating them to the runtime, while keeping the call stack clear to handle synchronous code. This enables JavaScript to run efficiently and respond to user interactions and other events in a timely manner.

## In More detail, The Event Loop Works As Follows

1. The JavaScript runtime starts with a single call stack, which is initially empty.
2. When a function is called, it is added to the top of the call stack.
3. As functions complete, they are removed from the top of the call stack.
4. When the call stack is empty, the event loop checks the event queue for tasks to execute.
5. If there are tasks in the event queue, the event loop picks the first task and pushes it onto the call stack.
6. The task is executed, and any further asynchronous calls are added to the event queue.
7. Once the task is complete, the event loop continues to check the event queue and execute any additional tasks.
