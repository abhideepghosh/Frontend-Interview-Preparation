## Definition Of Selectors In HTML

- In HTML, selectors are used to identify and target specific elements or groups of elements in an HTML document. There are several types of selectors in HTML, including:
  1. Element selectors - these target all elements of a specific type. For example, the selector p targets all <p> elements.
  2. ID selectors - these target a specific element with a unique ID. For example, the selector #myElement targets the element with id="myElement".
  3. Class selectors - these target all elements with a specific class. For example, the selector .myClass targets all elements with class="myClass".
  4. Attribute selectors - these target elements with a specific attribute or attribute value. For example, the selector [href] targets all elements with a href attribute, while the selector [href="#"] targets all elements with a href attribute equal to #.
  5. Pseudo-classes - these target elements based on their state or position in the document. For example, the selector :hover targets elements when the mouse is over them, while the selector :first-child targets the first child element of its parent.
  6. Pseudo-elements - these target specific parts of an element, such as its first line or first letter. For example, the selector ::first-line targets the first line of a paragraph.
- Selectors can be combined and nested to create more complex selectors. For example, the selector ul li a targets all <a> elements that are descendants of an <li> element, which is itself a descendant of a <ul> element.
