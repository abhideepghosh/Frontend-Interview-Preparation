## Define All The Components Of JavaScript Runtime In The Browser

- The JavaScript runtime in a browser is the environment that executes JavaScript code on the client-side. It consists of several components that work together to execute JavaScript code and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page.

## The JavaScript runtime in a browser includes the following components:

1. JavaScript engine: This is the core component that parses and executes JavaScript code. The JavaScript engine converts the JavaScript code into machine code that can be executed by the computer's processor. Popular JavaScript engines used in browsers include V8 (used in Chrome and Opera), SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox), and Chakra (used in Microsoft Edge).

2. DOM: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a hierarchical structure that represents the web page's HTML and XML elements. The DOM provides a way for JavaScript code to interact with and manipulate the web page's content and structure. JavaScript code can access and modify the DOM using the browser's built-in DOM API.

3. Event loop: The event loop is responsible for handling asynchronous JavaScript code, such as user input events, AJAX requests, and timeouts. When an asynchronous event occurs, the event loop adds the event to a queue and waits for the JavaScript engine to finish executing the current task. Once the engine is idle, the event loop retrieves the next event from the queue and executes its corresponding callback function.
4. Callback Queue: Callback Queue or the event queue is where the asynchronous JavaScript functions are stored and, they are picked up by the event loop and pushed to the stack maintaining the non blocking event loop concurrency model.

5. Web APIs: Web APIs are interfaces that provide access to browser-specific features, such as the geolocation API, the canvas API, and the WebSocket API. Web APIs are not part of the JavaScript language but are provided by the browser's runtime environment.

6. Call stack: The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the execution context of the JavaScript code. Whenever a function is called, its execution context is added to the top of the call stack, and when the function returns, its execution context is removed from the top of the call stack.

7. Memory heap: The memory heap is a region of memory where objects are allocated and stored during JavaScript runtime. Objects that are no longer referenced by the JavaScript code are automatically garbage collected to free up memory.

## Summary

In summary, the JavaScript runtime in a browser is a complex environment that includes several components working together to execute JavaScript code and manipulate the web page's content and structure. Understanding how these components work together is essential for writing efficient and scalable client-side JavaScript code.
