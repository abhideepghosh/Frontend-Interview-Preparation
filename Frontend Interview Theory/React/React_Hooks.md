## Definition Of React Hooks

- React Hooks are the built-in functions that permit developers for using the state and lifecycle methods within React components. These are newly added features made available in React 16.8 version.
- Each lifecycle of a component is having 3 phases which include mount, unmount, and update. Along with that, components have properties and states. Hooks will allow using these methods by developers for improving the reuse of code with higher flexibility navigating the component tree.
- Hooks allow developers to write simpler and more readable code, as well as make it easier to reuse and share logic between components.
- They also make it easier to reason about state changes, as the stateful logic is encapsulated in the hook rather than spread out across the component.
