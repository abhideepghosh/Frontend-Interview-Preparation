## Definition Of JSX

- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files. It is used primarily in React to define the user interface components that make up a web application.
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using functions like appendChild( ) or createElement( ).
- JSX is not strictly necessary for building React applications, but it is a commonly used feature of the library because it allows developers to write code that is easier to read and understand. By using JSX, developers can define user interface components in a way that closely resembles HTML, which can make the code more intuitive and easier to maintain.
