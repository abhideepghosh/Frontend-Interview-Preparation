## Definition of UseEffect Hook In React

- The useEffect hook is one of the most commonly used hooks in React. It allows you to perform side effects in functional components, like fetching data from an API, subscribing to events, or updating the document title.
- The useEffect hook takes a function as its first argument, which is called after the component is rendered. This function can return a cleanup function, which is called before the component is unmounted or re-rendered. The useEffect hook can also take a second argument, an array of dependencies, which determines when the effect should be re-run.
- By using the useEffect hook, we are able to perform side effects in a functional component that would normally require a class component and lifecycle methods. This makes our code simpler, more concise, and easier to reason about.
