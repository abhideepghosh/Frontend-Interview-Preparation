## Ways To Manage State In React

1. Class Components: If you're using class components in React, you can define state as a class property and update it using the setState() method.
2. Function Components with Hooks: If you're using function components in React, you can use the useState() hook to manage state.
3. Redux: If you need to manage global state across multiple components, you can use Redux, a popular state management library for React. Redux provides a centralized store to manage state and a set of actions to update it. Components can subscribe to the store to access the state and dispatch actions to update it.
