## Definition Of Refs In React

- In React, a ref is a way to access the DOM node or React element created by a component. Refs are used when we need to access a DOM element directly and not through the component state or props.

## Refs provide a way to access the DOM element in the following scenarios

1. Managing focus, text selection, or media playback
2. Triggering imperative animations or integrating with third-party DOM libraries
3. Responding to user events that happen outside of the React component hierarchy
