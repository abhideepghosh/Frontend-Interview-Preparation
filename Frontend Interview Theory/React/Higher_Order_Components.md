## Definition Of HOC:

- A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional functionality. In other words, it is a pattern that allows you to reuse component logic by wrapping components with other components.
- HOCs are used in React to share behavior between components. They can be used to add common functionality such as logging, error handling, authentication, and data fetching to multiple components without repeating code.
