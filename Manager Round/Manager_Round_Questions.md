## Q1. What is the correlation between management and leadership?

- By definition, managers assign tasks, maintain work reports, and ensure efficiency standards in a team. Leaders focus on aligning goals and influencing a team with broader business objectives.
- A manager works under a hierarchical system with a title. Good leadership qualities are essential for this role. Simply ensuring that work gets completed on time does not ensure team growth. They must have emotional intelligence, vision, and the ability to inspire team members when implementing new ideas.

## Q2. How do you set priorities for your team and yourself at work?

- To answer this question, show you are consistent with setting priorities.

1. Make sure every team member has clarity on the objective by discussing priorities regularly.
2. Create a list of tasks for every team member using a project management tool.
3. Identify urgent and important tasks, and schedule them accordingly.
4. Create a realistic time frame when delegating tasks and be flexible.

## Q3. How would you handle conflicts with your co-workers?

- Your recruiter wants to know how you have handled working relationships in your previous organisation. In short, they want to know how adaptive your communication skills are.

1. Do mention that you focus on actively listening to their concern. Elaborate that you listen and show empathy towards the co-worker without blaming their behaviour.
2. It is essential for managers to listen and react with no biases when co-workers have conflicts. You can try to understand the root of the issue and resolve them objectively. At the same time, you have to communicate HR policies clearly and focus on building mutual trust.

## Q4. What is your definition of success?

1. Success can be a very subjective term. But you have to voice out your work perspective when you define success.
2. Here, the recruiter wants to see how you manage daily work and help team members achieve targets. Speak about your previous achievements and mention what was expected from you there. Also, do mention your work ethics as a manager.

## Q5. What is your ideal work environment?

1. The recruiter asks this management interview question to know if you are suited for their work culture. They would want to know the situations that can potentially create a bottleneck for you.
2. Be honest and tell them how you can deal with high-pressure and unexpected changes. You can even highlight difficult situations in your previous job. Take your prospective employer through your past hurdles at work and emphasise the steps you took to overcome them.

## Q6. What is the most crucial skill you have learned in your previous managerial job?

1. This question is tricky. The recruiter wants to know how you will apply your skills in managing and completing projects for the new company.
2. Try to answer this question with examples. Maybe you learned how to negotiate timelines with your previous team members. Elaborate on that.

## Q7. How do you handle your team when they disagree with your idea?

1. It is a general management interview question in every industry. Since you act as a team lead and implement new ideas, not everyone in the team will agree every time.
2. Mention that you provide evidence to support your idea. If team members still do not agree, you ask them for suggestions. Then you and your team members come to a common conclusion.
3. Answering this question in this way helps the recruiter understand your communication and negotiation skills.

## Q8. How do you motivate yourself when there is high pressure?

1. Managers deal with a lot of pressure. When they are not motivated enough, it isnâ€™t easy to align team members with business objectives.
2. You can mention that you love your job and believe in what you do. Also mention that you are a team player and that, when your team members succeed, you encourage them.

## Q9. How do you react to criticism from your seniors?

1. Show that you learn from your errors and do not shy away from accepting your mistakes.
2. This answer will show that you are willing to learn and help the organisation meet its goals.
