## Q1. What is the correlation between management and leadership?

- By definition, managers assign tasks, maintain work reports, and ensure efficiency standards in a team. Leaders focus on aligning goals and influencing a team with broader business objectives.
- A manager works under a hierarchical system with a title. Good leadership qualities are essential for this role. Simply ensuring that work gets completed on time does not ensure team growth. They must have emotional intelligence, vision, and the ability to inspire team members when implementing new ideas.
