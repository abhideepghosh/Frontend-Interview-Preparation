## Differences Between Functional Components And Class Components

1. Syntax: Functional components are defined as plain JavaScript functions, while class components are defined as ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class.
2. State and lifecycle methods: Functional components cannot have state or use lifecycle methods, while class components can. Functional components can use the useState hook to manage local state, but class components have access to the this.state property and the setState method.
3. Code structure: Functional components are usually shorter and more concise, as they only consist of a function body. Class components tend to be longer and more verbose, as they include a constructor, lifecycle methods, and class properties.
4. Performance: Functional components are generally faster and have a smaller memory footprint than class components, as they do not create new instances of the component class.
5. Use cases: Functional components are ideal for simple components that do not need state or lifecycle methods. Class components are useful for more complex components that require state management and lifecycle methods.

## Conclusion

- Overall, both functional and class components have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your application.
- With the introduction of React hooks, functional components can now handle state and lifecycle methods, making them a more viable option for complex components.
