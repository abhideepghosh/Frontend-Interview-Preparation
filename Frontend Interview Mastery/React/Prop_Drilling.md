## Definition Of Prop Drilling

- Prop drilling is a term used in React to describe the process of passing props through multiple layers of components in order to reach a component that needs access to that prop. This can result in a lot of extra code and make it harder to maintain and update the codebase.
- Prop drilling can make code more complex and difficult to read and maintain. To avoid prop drilling, you can use other patterns like context or Redux to manage state and avoid the need to pass props through multiple layers of components. Alternatively, you can also use a higher-order component (HOC) or render props to pass props more efficiently to the desired component.
