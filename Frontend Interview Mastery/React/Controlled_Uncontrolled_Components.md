## Definitions Of Controlled And Uncontrolled Components

- In React, components can be classified as either controlled or uncontrolled based on how they manage their data.
- A controlled component is a component that receives its data via props and notifies its parent component when data changes via callbacks. The parent component has complete control over the data and manages all of its changes. In other words, the state of the component is "controlled" by the parent.
- An uncontrolled component is a component that manages its data internally using a reference to its own DOM element. The data is managed using the "ref" attribute instead of being managed by the parent component. In other words, the state of the component is "uncontrolled" by the parent.
- Controlled components are typically used when the parent component needs to manage the state of the child component, while uncontrolled components are typically used when the child component needs to manage its own state.
- In general, controlled components provide better performance and are easier to test and maintain, while uncontrolled components provide more flexibility and are easier to use in certain scenarios, such as working with third-party libraries that require direct access to the DOM.

## Differences Between Controlled And Uncontrolled Components

1. Data management: In a controlled component, data is managed by the parent component, while in an uncontrolled component, data is managed internally by the component itself.
2. State management: In a controlled component, the state is managed by the parent component, while in an uncontrolled component, the state is managed internally by the component itself.
3. Event handling: In a controlled component, event handling is managed by the parent component via callbacks, while in an uncontrolled component, event handling is managed by the component itself.
