## Definition Of useState In React

- The useState() is a built-in React Hook that allows you for having state variables in functional components. It should be used when the DOM has something that is dynamically manipulating/controlling.
- The idea with the usage of hooks is that we will be able to keep our code more functional and avoid class-based components if they are not required.
