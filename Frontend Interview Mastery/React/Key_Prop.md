## Definition Of Key Prop

- The "key" prop is a special attribute in React that is used to help identify each child component in a list of components. It is a unique identifier that allows React to optimize the rendering of components, making it faster and more efficient.
- When you have a list of components in React, React needs to know how to efficiently update the list when changes occur, such as when an item is added or removed.
- The "key" prop helps React to identify which components have changed, which ones have been added, and which ones have been removed.
- By using a unique key, React can update only the changed components, rather than updating the entire list.
