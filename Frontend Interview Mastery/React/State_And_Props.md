## State And Props

- State and props are two important concepts in React that are used to manage and pass data between components.
- State represents the internal state of a component, which can change over time in response to user input or other events. State is managed within a component and can only be updated using the setState() method. When state changes, React will automatically re-render the component and its children to reflect the updated state.
- Props, on the other hand, are properties that are passed down from a parent component to its child components. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component. Instead, the parent component is responsible for updating the props if necessary.
