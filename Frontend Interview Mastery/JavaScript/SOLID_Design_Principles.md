## SOLID Design Principles For Object Oriented Design
SOLID is an acronym for five key design principles in Object-Oriented Design (OOP) that aim to build more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software systems. Each letter represents a specific principle:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
	- A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.
	- This principle encourages the idea that a class should do one thing and do it well. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
	- Software entities (such as classes, modules, and functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
	- This principle encourages developers to design their code in a way that new functionality can be added through extension without altering existing code. This promotes a more stable and maintainable system.
	- In simple words, this allows adding new functionality without changing existing code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
	- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without altering the correctness of the program. This ensures consistency and predictable behavior.
	- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
	- This principle ensures that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. It maintains the expected behavior of the program when using polymorphism.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
	- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
	- Break down large interfaces into smaller, specific ones to avoid exposing unnecessary functionality.
	- This principle suggests that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. It promotes the creation of small, specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
	- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
	- Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
	- This principle encourages the use of abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) to decouple high-level modules from low-level implementation details. It promotes flexibility and ease of modification.
	- In simple words, High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This decouple components and make them more adaptable.

## Following these principles leads to several benefits:
1. Increased code maintainability: Smaller, focused classes are easier to understand and modify.
2. Improved flexibility: Changing requirements can be addressed by extending existing functionality without rewriting code.
3. Reduced coupling: Dependencies between classes are minimized, making the system more resilient to changes.
4. Enhanced testability: Well-defined and isolated classes are easier to test independently.
5. Remember, SOLID principles are guidelines, not strict rules. Applying them requires judgment and adapting them to specific situations.

## Conclusion
By adhering to these SOLID principles, developers can create code that is more modular, maintainable, and adaptable to changes. These principles contribute to the overall design quality of object-oriented systems.
