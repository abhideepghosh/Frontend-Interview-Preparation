## Definition Of Promise In JavaScript

- Promises in JavaScript are used to handle asynchronous operations. They are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
- Promises are used to handle multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.
