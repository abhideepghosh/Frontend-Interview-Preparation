## Definition Of OOP

- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.
- We use Objects to model the real world or abstract features.
- Objects may contain both properties and methods. By using objects, we pack the data and its corrosponding behaviour into one block.
- OOP enables us to better organize code, making it more flexible and easier to maintain.

## Four Pillars Of OOP:

1. Abstraction: Hiding details that don't matter, allowing us to get an overview perspective of the thing we are implementing, instead of messing with details that really don't matter to our implementation.
2. Encapsulation: Keeping properties and methods private inside the class so that they are not accessible from outside the class. Some methods can be exposed as a public interface (API).
3. Inheritance: In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes.
4. Polymorphism: The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

## OOP And JavaScript

- Objects are instantiated from a class, which are functions like a blueprint in JavaScript. Instantiation is creation of instance from a class.
- In JavaScript, every object by default gets a prototype object linked to it. In case of instance of a class, the prototype of the class is linked to the instance.
- JavaScript follows Prototypal Inheritance.
- Proptotypal Inheritance: The prototype contains values and methods (behaviour) that are accesible to all objects linked to that prototype. Behaviour is delegated to the linked prototype object.
